### **🌟 Key Features**


#### **1. Live "Auto-Strategy" Engine**
Instead of static advice (e.g., "Buy at $20"), the dashboard uses **TradingView's Technical Analysis Widget**.
* **What it does:** It aggregates dozens of real-time indicators (Moving Averages, Oscillators, Pivots).
* **The Output:** A live speedometer gauge showing **Strong Sell**, **Sell**, **Neutral**, **Buy**, or **Strong Buy**.
* **Timeframes:**
    * *Long-term Assets:* 1-Day Interval (Swing Trading focus).
    * *CFD/Day Trading:* 15-Minute Interval (Intraday focus).


#### **2. Smart Market Status & Timer**
The header contains a dynamic status bar driven by custom JavaScript:
* **Auto-Detection:** Automatically calculates if the US Market (NYSE/Nasdaq) is currently **OPEN** or **CLOSED**.
* **Countdown:**
    * If Closed: Shows time remaining until Open (e.g., *"Opens in 04h 12m"*).
    * If Open: Shows time remaining until Close (e.g., *"Closes in 02h 30m"*).
* **Local Time:** Automatically adjusts to the user's local timezone.


#### **3. Risk-Segmented Asset Tracking**
The dashboard tracks 4 distinct asset classes to create a balanced portfolio:
* 🟢 **#1 Safer (SSLN):** *iShares Physical Silver.* Tracks spot price. Low volatility. Wealth preservation.
* 🔵 **#2 Growth (WPM):** *Wheaton Precious Metals.* Streaming company. Safer than miners, higher yield than spot.
* 🟠 **#3 Aggressive (AG):** *First Majestic Silver.* Pure-play miner. High volatility (moves 2x faster than spot).
* 🔴 **Day Trade Only (CFD):** *Spot Silver.* Leveraged derivative. High fee risk (Swap fees).


#### **4. Deep-Link "Bullion Buttons"**
* The "Buy on T212" buttons are custom-styled silver bars.
* **Function:** Clicking a button does not just go to the homepage; it opens the **specific instrument's trading page** inside Trading 212, saving you search time.
